I need you to act as a **Blogger and Google Workspace Specialist**. I am working on a "Multipurpose Website Builder" project, and I need you to restore the context from a previous session.

Here is the full project breakdown. Please analyze this state before generating new content.

### 1. Project Architecture
We are building a **Headless Commerce System** using Blogger as the frontend host, but bypassing its native limitations.
* **The Frontend:** A custom **Blogger XML Theme** (`ThemeTemplate.html`) that acts as an app shell. It uses Bootstrap 5 and loads data dynamically.
* **The Backend:** **Google Apps Script (GAS)** (`Code.gs`) acting as an API. It serves data via **JSONP** to avoid CORS issues.
* **The Database:** **Google Sheets** stores 3 tabs: `Settings` (config), `Entries` (orders/leads), and `TextMapping` (translations).
* **The Configuration:** A Web App UI (`Builder.html`) hosted on GAS allows me to configure the site (colors, toggles, data sources) and generates/pushes the XML theme to Blogger or GitHub.

### 2. The Logic Flow
1.  **Init:** The Blogger theme loads and defines `window.BASE_SCRIPT_URL` (the GAS Web App URL).
2.  **Fetch:** `runtime.js` on the client side executes a JSONP fetch to GAS.
3.  **Render:** GAS returns Settings, Products, and Translations. `runtime.js` initializes the other modules (`products.js`, `cart.js`, etc.).
4.  **Action:** Orders are sent back to GAS (`saveEntry`) and saved to the `Entries` sheet.

### 3. Current File Status
We have finalized the code for the following files:
* **Backend:** `Code.gs` (Handles `doGet` routing, Settings CRUD, GitHub Pushing, and Base64 XML generation).
* **Builder UI:** `Builder.html` (A 4-step wizard to configure branding, features, and export the theme).
* **Theme:** `ThemeTemplate.html` (The master XML shell with dynamic CSS variables for Dark/Light mode and Primary/Secondary colors).
* **Client Assets (JS):**
    * `runtime.js` (The orchestrator).
    * `products.js` (Grid rendering & filtering).
    * `cart.js` (LocalStorage cart + Order submission).
    * `wishlist.js` (LocalStorage favorites).
    * `quickview.js` (Product details modal).
    * `i18n.js` (Translation & RTL handling).
    * `modal-guard.js` (Fixes "stuck" Bootstrap backdrops).
    * `search.js` (NEW: Client-side search filtering).

### 4. Recent Fixes & Updates (Crucial Context)
* **Search Module:** We just added `search.js` and updated `Builder.html` to have a "Include Search Bar" toggle. `ThemeTemplate.html` was updated to conditionally render the search input in the Navbar.
* **Bootstrap Conflict:** We implemented an aggressive "Modal Guard" in `cart.js` and `ThemeTemplate` that removes `.modal-backdrop` elements to prevent the site from freezing.
* **CSS 404 Bug:** I previously saw a "Text Dump" on my screen (unstyled HTML). We identified that `settings.asset_base_url` in the Google Sheet was missing or incorrect, causing 404s for the CSS files.

### 5. Immediate Next Steps
I am currently at the stage where the code is complete, but I need to:
1.  Verify the Search Module implementation.
2.  Fix the `asset_base_url` in my Google Sheet.
3.  Move on to creating a **User Manual / Deployment Guide** or handling the final **Deployment** steps.

**Are you ready to continue from this point?**
